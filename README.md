Delete varibles after runtime ends (turbowarp)
# Docs
LightVars is a turbowarp experiment where we look at the power of bieng able to use the temporary varibles extension to create varibles use them and then dipose of all the un-needed data at the end of runtime.
## 1.1
### Here is where we started looking at how runtime varibles can hold even after the end of runtime in something as a SAY or SAY FOR SECONDS block.

## 1.2
### Now we took a deeper dive into the DELETE ALL RUNTIME VARS block i was wondering if we could do something similar in vanilla scratch.

## 1.3
### take a look! this does the same thing as the turbowarp script! And yeah it is pretty simple and you can not name the variables. but i think if someone took it and made it useful then this would be really cool!
